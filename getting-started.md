# Getting Started!

Welcome to Tama! This guide will help you adopt your first virtual pet and get started.

## What is Tama?

Tama is a virtual pet bot for Discord. Adopt a pet, take care of it, play games, and watch it grow! Your pet needs regular attention - feed it, play with it, and keep it happy.

## Quick Start

### 1. Adopt Your First Pet

Use the `/adopt` command to see available pets and adopt one.

Each pet costs stars (⭐). You start with some stars, and you can earn more by playing games or voting for the bot.

### 2. Check Your Profile

View your pet's stats and your currency with the `/profile` command.

Your profile shows:
- **Bells** (🔔) - Used to buy items from the shop
- **Stars** (⭐) - Used to adopt pets
- **Pet stats** - Hunger, Energy, and Love levels

### 3. Take Care of Your Pet

Your pet's stats will decrease over time. Keep them healthy by:
- **Feeding** - Buy food from `/shop`, then use items from your inventory (via the Inventory button in `/profile`)
- **Playing** - Use toys from your inventory to boost your pet's love level
- **Monitoring** - Check your pet's stats regularly to prevent it from dying

{% hint style="warning" %}
If your pet's stats drop too low for too long, it will die! You can revive it with special items from the shop (within 7 days).
{% endhint %}

## Earning Currency

Play games to earn bells and buy items for your pet with the `/play random` command, which launches a random minigame. 

You can also play today's special daily challenge with `/play daily`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Daily games are more rewarding and feature unique modifiers!
