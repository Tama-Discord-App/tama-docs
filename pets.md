## Adopting a Pet

### How to Adopt

Use `/adopt` to browse available pets. Each pet has:
- **Type** - Cat, dog, bird, and more
- **Rarity** - Common, rare, or exclusive
- **Price** - Stars required to adopt
- **Stats** - Base hunger, energy, and love levels

Select a pet and confirm to adopt it. You can only have one active pet at a time.

### Pet Rarity

Pets come in three rarities:
- **Common** - Standard pets, lower prices
- **Rare** - Special pets with unique appearances
- **Exclusive** - Limited-time or seasonal pets

Rarer pets don't have better stats, they're just more unique!

## Pet Stats

Your pet has three important stats that you need to manage:

### Hunger (🍎)
- Decreases over time
- Restore by feeding your pet food items
- Low hunger makes your pet show a hungry icon

### Energy (⚡)
- Decreases over time
- Can be restored with rest items
- Low energy makes your pet look tired

### Love (💖)
- Decreases slowly over time
- Increase by playing with your pet or using toys
- High love makes your pet happy!

## Stat Decay

Your pet's stats naturally decrease over time:
- Stats decay even when you're offline
- Each pet type has different decay rates
- Check your pet regularly to keep stats healthy

You can see when stats were last updated in your profile.

## Feeding Your Pet

Use items from your inventory to feed your pet:

1. Use `/profile` to open your profile
2. Click the "Inventory" button
3. Select a food item to use
4. Confirm to apply it to your pet
5. Your pet's hunger will increase

Different food items restore different amounts of hunger.

## Using Toys and Items

The same process works for all items:
- **Food items** restore hunger
- **Energy items** restore energy  
- **Toys** boost love and happiness
- **Special items** like name tags and revival items have unique effects

All items are used through your inventory in the profile menu.

## Pet Death and Revival

### When Pets Die

If your pet's stats drop too low for too long, it will die. When this happens:
- Your pet's icon changes to a grave/dead state
- You can't interact with it normally
- You have 7 days to revive it

### Reviving Your Pet

To revive a dead pet:
1. Buy a revival item from the shop
2. Use it from your inventory
3. Your pet comes back with 50% stats

{% hint style="danger" %}
After 7 days, you can no longer revive your pet and will need to adopt a new one.
{% endhint %}

## Renaming Your Pet

You can rename your pet using a Name Tag item from the shop:
1. Buy a Name Tag with bells
2. Use it from your inventory
3. Enter your pet's new name (max 32 characters)

## Tips for Pet Care

- Check your pet at least once a day
- Stock up on food items from the shop
- Play games to earn bells for items
- Set up notifications (if enabled) to get reminders
- Watch for the pet's visual state to know what it needs
