# Settings & Preferences

Customize your Tama experience and manage server settings.

## User Settings

Use `/settings user` to manage your personal preferences.

### Available User Settings

#### DM Notifications 🔔
Choose whether to receive direct messages from Tama:
- Pet care reminders when your pet needs attention
- Vote reminders when you can vote on top.gg

Toggle this setting on or off based on your preference.

#### Skip Confirmations ⚡
Skip the confirmation dialog when purchasing items from the shop:
- **Enabled**: Buy items instantly without confirmation
- **Disabled**: Show confirmation before each purchase (default)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enable this only if you're comfortable with instant purchases. It can save time but increases the risk of accidental buys.
{% endhint %}

## Server Settings (Admin Only)

Server administrators can configure Tama for their server using `/settings server`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This command requires the "Manage Server" permission!
{% endhint %}
